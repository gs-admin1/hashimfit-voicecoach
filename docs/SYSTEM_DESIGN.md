## Hashim - AI-Powered Personal Fitness Trainer

### High-Level Architecture

The Hashim application follows a modern web architecture pattern with a React frontend, Supabase backend-as-a-service, and integrated AI services. The system is designed for scalability, security, and maintainability.

#### Architecture Principles
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- **Real-Time**: Live updates for workout progress and chat interactions
- **Serverless**: Edge functions for scalable AI processing
- **Secure**: Row-Level Security (RLS) and JWT authentication
- **Extensible**: Modular design for easy feature additions

### Key Components and Services

#### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for app state
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

#### Backend (Supabase)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions
- **Authentication**: Built-in auth with JWT tokens
- **Storage**: File storage for meal images and user uploads
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless functions for AI processing
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates

#### AI Services
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Workout plan generation, nutrition analysis, chat assistant
- **AWS Rekognition**: Food detection and image analysis
- **Custom Prompts**: Specialized prompts for fitness and nutrition domains

#### External Integrations
- **AWS S3/Rekognition**: Image processing and food recognition
- **OpenAI API**: Natural language processing and generation
- **Supabase Storage**: Secure file uploads and management

### Data Flow

#### User Onboarding Flow
1. User creates account via Supabase Auth
2. Fitness assessment data collected via React forms
3. Assessment sent to OpenAI via Edge Function
4. Personalized workout plans generated and stored
5. User profile updated with preferences and goals

#### Workout Tracking Flow
1. User selects scheduled workout from dashboard
2. Exercise progress tracked in real-time
3. Completion data stored in PostgreSQL
4. Progress metrics calculated and displayed
5. AI assistant provides feedback and motivation

#### Nutrition Tracking Flow
1. User captures meal photo via device camera
2. Image uploaded to Supabase Storage
3. Edge Function processes image with AWS Rekognition
4. Food items sent to OpenAI for nutrition analysis
5. Results stored and displayed in user dashboard

#### AI Chat Flow
1. User sends message via chat interface
2. Message context enriched with user data
3. Edge Function processes request with OpenAI
4. Response streamed back to user in real-time
5. Conversation history stored for context

### Scalability Considerations

#### Database Scaling
- **Read Replicas**: For handling read-heavy workloads
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer for efficient connection management
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimized indexes for common query patterns
- **Partitioning**: Time-based partitioning for large tables

#### API Scaling
- **Edge Functions**: Auto-scaling serverless compute
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and overuse
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for static assets

#### Frontend Scaling
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for optimal bundle sizes
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format and responsive images
- **Service Worker**: Offline capability and caching
- **Progressive Web App**: Native-like mobile experience

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, stateless authentication
- **Row-Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission system
- **Session Management**: Secure token refresh and logout

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage of sensitive credentials
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of all user inputs
- **HTTPS Only**: SSL/TLS for all communications

#### Privacy & Compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary user data
- **User Consent**: Clear privacy policy and data usage
- **Data Retention**: Automated cleanup of old data
- **Export/Delete**: User control over personal data

### Fault Tolerance

#### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback for failed AI services
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for UI crashes

#### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Health Checks**: Automated system health monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and throughput tracking
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error logging and alerting
- **User Analytics**: Usage patterns and feature adoption

#### Backup & Recovery
- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **File Storage**: Redundant storage across multiple regions
- **Disaster Recovery**: Documented procedures for major outages
- **Data Migration**: Tools for database schema changes
